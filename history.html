      <p>Peter Kirk, a steel tycoon from Britain who came to the Pacific Northwest in search of new development prospects in the 1880s, is honored by the name of the city. On the eastern shore of Lake Washington, he envisioned building a thriving industrial metropolis focused on steel production, the "Pittsburgh of the West." With the expectation that a ship canal would soon connect Lake Washington to Puget Sound, Kirk and a number of well-known Seattle businessmen constructed the Moss Bay Iron and Steel Works in 1880 with the goal of utilizing the mineral wealth of Snoqualmie Pass. The long-awaited ship canal and a rail line to the Pass were eventually built, but the mill had to close before any steel was ever made due to the economic collapse of 1893.<br>
        <br>With 400 residents, Kirkland incorporated in 1905 despite the steel venture's failure. Shipbuilding and wool milling quickly proved to be vital to the city's early growth. Established in Kirkland in 1892, Washington's first wool mill supplied goods to prospectors during the Alaskan Gold Rush and later to the American military during World War I. The Lake Washington Shipyard in Kirkland began building warships for the U.S. Navy in 1940 after the ship canal was opened in 1917, connecting Lake Washington to the ocean. On what is now known as Carillon Point, more than 25 ships were built there during World War II.<br>
        <br>The nearby Town of Houghton was a distinct community for a large portion of its history, but by the 1960s, the two areas' interests had become more similar. Residents of Houghton and Kirkland decided to combine in 1968, creating a single city with 13,500 residents. Major annexations led to additional growth: Totem Lake joined the city in 1974, and South Juanita, North Rose Hill, and South Rose Hill were incorporated into Kirkland in 1988. One of the biggest municipal expansions in Washington State in almost two decades, these annexations added approximately 16,000 residents and three and a half square miles.<br>
        <br>Peter Kirk's dream of a prosperous city on the east shore of Lake Washington has come true, even though Kirkland did not develop into the steel-driven industrial hub he had first envisioned. With over 92,000 residents, Kirkland is a vibrant and expanding community today.<br></p>
